Hutton's textbook[^hutton-textbook]:
- I added the solutions for exercises 2-5 of Chapter 1 to the repository. I solved those tasks earlier on paper. You can find them in the "Chapter 1" section of the [README](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/blob/a79d8367687e1808f29245da1bef1cef0f346c13/exercises/textbook-hutton/README.md#ch1).

Hutton's textbook[^hutton-textbook]:
- I added the solutions for exercises 1-5 of Chapter 2 to the repository. You can find them in the "Chapter 2" section of the [README](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/blob/143d05b227c968c2fc04483a34fa1c44504ce8ad/exercises/textbook-hutton/README.md#ch2). I solved those tasks earlier on paper.  

  Remark: exercise 1 took much longer than expected. Instead of simply running the examples from the chapter in GHCi, as stated in the task, I decided to thoroughly analyze and document all contextually linked concepts, abstractions, and Haskell constructions I had learned up to that point. Since I had covered several chapters and consulted multiple supplemental resources, there were numerous concepts to include. I have included the [code](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/blob/143d05b227c968c2fc04483a34fa1c44504ce8ad/exercises/textbook-hutton/sol-hs/Chap2ex1.hs) and [explanations](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/blob/143d05b227c968c2fc04483a34fa1c44504ce8ad/exercises/textbook-hutton/sol-md/Chap2ex1.md) in the repository.

- Additional topic: `enumFromThenTo`  

  I came across this function while working on exercise 1 of Chapter 2. It generates a list of values with a specified step in between. Here are a few examples of its usage:

  ```
  ghci> :type enumFromThenTo
  enumFromThenTo :: Enum a => a -> a -> a -> [a]
  
  ghci> :type enumFromThenTo 1 2 10
  enumFromThenTo 1 2 10 :: (Enum a, Num a) => [a]
  
  ghci> enumFromThenTo (1::Int) ((1+1)::Int) (10::Int)
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
  ```

  I haven't decided where to store this piece of knowledge yet. I will leave the note here and find it later using the `ag` terminal utility.

Hutton's textbook[^hutton-textbook]:
- I read Chapters 3-4 again and made quick paper remarks for reference.
- I added the solutions for exercises 1-4 of Chapter 3 to the repository. You can find them in the [README](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/blob/6dc216372843e8fec949fe01a152e0c270dfd126/exercises/textbook-hutton/README.md#ch3).

Haskell

All studied materials:
- I drew another partial draft of mind map to sum up everything I had learned so far. This time it felt like something I would like to see in a final version.

Hutton's textbook:
- I read chapters 5-7 with notes and spent extra time on chapter's 7.3-7.4.  
  I pondered the `foldl` and `foldr` topic with pencil and paper to better understand and remember those functions nature. However, I still have questions about their type specification as well as implementation. Function composition topic (`f .g`) also needs extra studying.
- Chapters 5.5, 7.6, 7.7 and 8: I skimmed them through just to get a general impression of the content.

Учебник Hutton'a[^hutton-textbook]: ознакомительно прочитал главы 9-12. В 9-11 разбираются уже довольно объёмные примеры, которые нужно вдумчиво прорабатывать. Глава 12 знакомит с концепциями functors, applicatives и monads, и здесь я откровенно "поплыл", т.к. ещё не до конца усвоил теорию гл. 8 по типам, и в теме higher-order functions тоже пока слабоват.

Решил [кату](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56606694ec01347ce800001b/) начального уровня (код &ndash; [d624fd1](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/d624fd134e71a09c00acff2fca5ca1af50ad0ec9), тесты &ndash; [163d6aa](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/163d6aa4a34bf9c48a6a346fa5f8be62abf6cc71)).

Lipovača's textbook[^lipovača-textbook]: read chapters 1-6 with quick notes ([f5b4c0d](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/f5b4c0d2d2443dc14694ead5e5b3470ed47a086c)). I also skimmed through Chapter 7 to gain a general understanding of its content. Initially, I felt skeptical about the book due to its presentation format, which seemed childish. However, I discovered valuable bits of information there. They effectively addressed the gaps in Hutton's textbook[^hutton-textbook] chapters. This fact makes Lipovača's textbook a decent supplemental learning resource.

While reading, I had an insightful moment and improved yesterday's kata solution ([b15fcca](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/b15fcca2695710da9ed2dba67d01117d3faab141)).

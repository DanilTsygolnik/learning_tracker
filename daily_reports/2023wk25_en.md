Haskell

- I managed the textbooks about Haskell that I found and uploaded them to the cloud.
- I casually read chapters 1&ndash;3 from "Programming in Haskell" by Graham Hutton (2nd ed., 2016) [^tb-hutton] ([pdf](https://mega.nz/file/b10XkKKD#XLhYfT7GBsJsCgL3Nw0zCKkGzBAAvN2XbiSoIriIK-Y)) and made some notes on paper. I have decided to use this textbook as my main learning resource for Haskell basics. Additionally, I will keep "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good" by Miran Lipovaƒça [^tb-haskel-for-gg] nearby for quick reference.
- I quickly skimmed through chapters 1, 3, and 4 of "Functional Programming For Dummies" by John Paul Mueller (2019) [^tb-dummies-mueller] ([pdf](https://mega.nz/file/i5VEiBQT#PvCSkNli-E55ae8hZ9PW0ML8DyQ6QPSaFFeVO7XWA-0)). I have decided to read it occasionally, whenever I have some spare time, to revisit useful concepts worth recalling (such as a comparison of popular programming paradigms). It might be beneficial to revisit certain topics later on, once I have gained some programming experience in Haskell, to better understand its advantages and disadvantages compared to Python.

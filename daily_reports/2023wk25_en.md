Haskell

- I managed the textbooks about Haskell that I found and uploaded them to the cloud.
- I casually read chapters 1&ndash;3 from "Programming in Haskell" by Graham Hutton (2nd ed., 2016) [^tb-hutton] ([pdf](https://mega.nz/file/b10XkKKD#XLhYfT7GBsJsCgL3Nw0zCKkGzBAAvN2XbiSoIriIK-Y)) and made some notes on paper. I have decided to use this textbook as my main learning resource for Haskell basics. Additionally, I will keep "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good" by Miran Lipovača [^tb-haskel-for-gg] nearby for quick reference.
- I quickly skimmed through chapters 1, 3, and 4 of "Functional Programming For Dummies" by John Paul Mueller (2019) [^tb-dummies-mueller] ([pdf](https://mega.nz/file/i5VEiBQT#PvCSkNli-E55ae8hZ9PW0ML8DyQ6QPSaFFeVO7XWA-0)). I have decided to read it occasionally, whenever I have some spare time, to revisit useful concepts worth recalling (such as a comparison of popular programming paradigms). It might be beneficial to revisit certain topics later on, once I have gained some programming experience in Haskell, to better understand its advantages and disadvantages compared to Python.

Haskell

I casually read Chapter 4 of Hutton's textbook[^tb-hutton] and have also [begun](https://t.me/DanilTsygolnik_edu_wip/2) a thorough examination of Chapters 1-4, creating a mind map on paper. My objective is to generate a series of concise notes that capture the most significant ideas from the textbook, connecting them through shared contexts. These notes will enhance the efficiency of material recall.

Haskell, basics

I have solved nearly every problem from Chapters 1-4 of Hutton's textbook. By referring to the textbook answers, I managed to identify and rectify a few mistakes I had made. However, several solutions still need to be verified using the `ghci` command.

I [keep making](https://t.me/DanilTsygolnik_edu_wip/3) mind maps on paper as a part of the textbook immersive reading. This process allows me to establish connections between concepts, definitions, and code examples, thus deepening my understanding of the Computer Science course. As a result, I find myself contemplating questions such as "What types of tasks can be solved using computer programs?", "How does the computer execute programs?" and "What is the underlying theory behind popular programming paradigms and styles?".

In addition to these thoughts, I have uploaded a solution to the second exercise in Chapter 1 ([6d6faf5](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/6d6faf546d20773ba7d69e7c0daa664bb53a076b)).

Unit tests

Fortunately, I stumbled upon a helpful [guide](https://hmc-cs-131-spring2020.github.io/howtos/tests.html) that allowed me to write the first unit test ([7cf4afc](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/7cf4afcfde41405de56277b018f1c729422469f2)) for Chapter 1, Exercise 2 (as mentioned earlier). As I expected, the compilation failed with an error. The outcome didn't surprise me as I foresaw that building the project was needed first. To address this, I found a couple of handy resources:
- the [official manual](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) for instructions on installing the Stack software.
- the Hspec [documentation](https://hspec.github.io/).

After reading, I created a Stack project using the `stack new tb-solutions` command. By default, this command utilizes the `new-template.hsfiles` template. I delved into this theme and discovered valuable information on the official [Wiki page](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/). One section referenced the `kurt` template, so I searched for the author's textbook. I quickly skimmed through Chapter 35, which focused on building Stack projects, and Chapter 36, which delved into unit testing. The explanations seemed well-presented, so I saved the book for further examination ([pdf](https://mega.nz/file/SsshHLLS#NANngSOfZI-bPxhMKRb-jWXizEHG8qFrPVzhMtr6gy4)).

Haskell

I gained a basic understanding of `.hsfiles` and successfully created my first functional template for the `stack new` command.

To better understand the `stack new` and `stack build` commands, I performed around 20 project initializations and builds. I noted down my hands-on experience and crucial newfound pieces of knowledge.

Miscellaneous

I added a text alignment plugin in my Neovim config ([d2486f2](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/my_nvim_config/commit/d2486f2b425331a5a239b859e26f131630c1de14)). It's rich in features and shortcut customization options. I practiced a little with the `: EasyAlign` command to get going. The [table](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align#examples-using-predefined-rules) was helpful.

I also created a template for daily reports ([11bdb1a](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learning_tracker/commit/11bdb1a7a38627011c14bf1df5b408e352d710f6)).

Haskell

I kept learning about the `stack build` command. I have the following project structure to organize for coding exercise practice:
```
solutions-textbook
├── app
│   └── Main.hs
├── src
│   └── chXexY.hs       -- exercise solution
├── test
│   ├── Spec.hs
│   └── chXexYtest.hs   -- unit tests for solution module
├── solutions-textbook.cabal
├── Setup.hs
├── stack.yaml
└── stack.yaml.lock
```

However, I have not yet managed to build the project. I spent the entire day searching for a correct command in the terminal. Additionally, I have read chapters related to the `stack build` command from the following textbooks:
- "Get Programming With Haskell", Kurt, 2018.[^tb-kurt]
- "Haskell Programming from First Principles", by Allen & Moronuki, 2016.[^tb-allen-moronuki]

Haskell

I took advice from developers in a chat and started using `package.yaml` files for project configuration. Here are the benefits I've noticed so far:
1) Stack automatically generates a `project.cabal` file based on the properties from the `package.yaml`. It also includes any newly created module files in the build dependencies list.
2) I no longer need to worry about a known issue with missing packages ([fa19a1f](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/fa19a1f2b22e47f85cf9df203abc3999bbecdeb3)). By default, Stack utilizes the `package.yaml` if it exists in the project root. Any manual changes in `project.cabal` will be overwritten the first time a command like `stack build` is executed.

The Stack manual also recommends using `package.yaml` files, but I don't regret learning how to edit `project.cabal` files. I studied the topic for a few days, made draft notes, and then quickly transitioned to using `package.yaml` files. As a result, I rewrote my Stack templates accordingly ([e645c91](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/e645c91bc796ac6492692dc4e2b332346aeab079)).

Today, the main breakthrough was regarding module filenames. I realized the importance of using uppercase letters in Haskell files that contain modules (e.g., `src/Lib.hs`). That was an unexpected source of problems with the `stack build` command ([b2b0858](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/b2b08580cc694ba2fd92ac30396761cabb54c8a4)). After resolving the issue, I successfully built the project to solve tasks from Hutton's textbook[^tb-hutton] ([a4a0753](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/a4a0753bbbb523cfb36e857b811afd757af935f6)). Here is the first solution ([c3af78f](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/c3af78fe1d5e465c09bca280d4514f1b4cda2a25)) with unit tests ([cc4f3c7](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/cc4f3c72bfa9f6df30b0b3d99d0df21677ee11d7)).

I also came across some handy resources today, although I haven't had a chance to go through them yet. I saved them in a note for later reference ([2adfd47](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/2adfd471cf7d4588a11f601ce8d8147d2f83a31a)).

Haskell

In the `stack new` templates, I added the missing `hspec` to the build dependency list for each file ([8cdf1e4](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/8cdf1e4436990ece6e3cf8c49eccf297fcac2658), [efee667](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/efee6672e4ce7de3fa2520c937f7f18339923e3a)).

For the projects related to the textbook exercises:
1. Planned the project file structure and updated the `stack new` template accordingly ([42fb530](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/42fb53017a2accb281c3bd10b62c2f9bdd984449)).
2. Similarly updated the project directory for Hutton's textbook[^tb-hutton] exercises, including directory names and the README file ([8bf1bf2](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/8bf1bf2289541f5e2e88c31361bcef5613c8f761), [a75ddee](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/a75ddee5653d3f2ae995beb98ebcb92b148ecd2e), [53400b6](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/53400b676f7a0fe680b96d10921840fb73017876)).
3. Added a solution for exercise 1 in Hutton's chapter 1 ([72c14b9](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/72c14b970f393a21f09b88a98ce3da776a6b4b0c)) and updated the README ([8b0ed48](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/learn_haskell/commit/8b0ed48691b788b037ab6085aa30ca9fa5edc168)).


Miscellaneous

In my Neovim config, I added abbreviations for several symbols commonly used in my markdown reports ([00e6eae](https://github.com/DanilTsygolnik/my_nvim_config/commit/00e6eae9874fd1529148c846aad866fdde815aa8)).
